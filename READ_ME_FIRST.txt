Welcome to your Indika Gadol Website!

## How to Run
Simply double-click on `index.html` to open the website in your browser. No installation needed!

## Changing Images
I have used high-quality placeholder images from Unsplash. To use your own images:
1. Copy your photos into the `images` folder.
2. Open the HTML files (`index.html`, `about.html`, etc.) in a text editor (Notepad or VS Code).
3. Search for "https://images.unsplash.com..." and replace the link with `images/your-photo-name.jpg`.

## Deployment
Since you have the domain `indikagadol.kesug.com`, you can upload all these files (index.html, css folder, js folder, etc.) to your hosting provider's file manager (usually in `public_html`).

Enjoy your premium website!
